# Introduction

The Wallet Development Kit (WDK) lets you deploy non-custodial wallets supporting multiple blockchains in the most developer-friendly way possible and zero lock-in.

Whether you're building for your own custody or shipping self-custodial wallets for your users, WDK is flexible by design. If you want to go deeper, the lower-level APIs give you everything you need to build custom integrations from scratch.

This is just the beginning. If there's something you wish the SDK didâ€”tell us. We're listening.

## Your Responsibilities as a Private Beta Partner

As a participant in the WDK private beta, you have early access to powerful wallet development tools and features. In return, we ask that you:

- **Provide Feedback**: Share your experiences, suggestions, and any issues you encounter. Your feedback is essential for improving WDK before public release.
- **Report Bugs**: If you find any bugs or unexpected behavior, please let us know as soon as possible.
- **Respect Confidentiality**: Do not share access, documentation, or code outside your organization or team without prior approval.
- **Collaborate**: Engage with our team if you have questions, need support, or want to propose new features.

Your input will help shape the future of WDK and ensure it meets the needs of the developer community. Thank you for partnering with us!
