> **Note**: A seed phrase (also known as a recovery phrase or mnemonic) is a sequence of words that encodes the private key to your blockchain wallet. It acts as the master key to access and control your funds across supported blockchains. Anyone with access to your seed phrase can fully control your wallet, so it must be kept secure and never shared.

> **Account Abstraction** is a concept in Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains that allows for more flexible and programmable accounts. Instead of being limited to standard externally owned accounts (EOAs), account abstraction enables custom logic for transaction validation, gas payment, and signature schemes. This makes features like social recovery, multi-signature wallets, and gasless transactions possible.
>
> A **Paymaster** is a smart contract or service that can sponsor transaction fees (gas) on behalf of users. This allows users to interact with the blockchain without needing to hold the native token (e.g., ETH for Arbitrum) for gas, enabling use cases like gasless transactions or paying fees in alternative tokens.
>
> A **Bundler** is a service that collects user operations (transactions) and submits them to the blockchain in batches. This improves efficiency and can reduce costs, especially in account abstraction systems where multiple user operations are handled together.
>
>
> Other terms in this config:
> - **Entry Point**: The smart contract that acts as the main gateway for account abstraction operations.
> - **Chain ID**: The unique identifier for the blockchain network (e.g., 42161 for Arbitrum).
> - **Paymaster Token**: The token used to pay for transaction fees when using a paymaster (e.g., USDT).

> **Note**:
>
> **Gas cost** is the fee you pay to process transactions and execute smart contracts on a blockchain. Gas fees compensate network validators (or miners) for the computational resources required to verify and include your transaction in a block.
> - On networks like Ethereum and Arbitrum, every operation that **changes the blockchain’s state** — such as sending tokens, deploying a contract, or interacting with DeFi protocols — requires gas.
> - **Read-only actions** (like checking your balance or viewing data) do not require gas, because they don’t alter the blockchain’s state. For example, when you checked your balance in the previous step, no fee was charged.
> - Gas costs fluctuate based on network demand and transaction complexity.
> - Paying the correct gas fee ensures your transaction is processed in a timely manner. If you don’t provide enough gas, your transaction may fail or be delayed.
>
> Understanding gas costs is essential for managing your funds efficiently and avoiding failed or stuck transactions.

> **Note**:
> - **Sufficient USDT balance**: To successfully complete the transfer, your wallet must have enough USDT to cover both the amount you want to send and the transaction fee (gas cost) if you are using a paymaster to pay fees in USDT. This means your required balance will be slightly higher than the transfer amount.
> - **Typical transfer cost**: On the Arbitrum network, the transaction fee for a simple token transfer is usually very low—often less than $0.10 USD (but this can vary with network conditions). Always check the quoted gas cost before confirming.
> - **On-chain transactions**: Sending tokens is a state-changing operation, meaning it updates the blockchain’s ledger. This is why you pay a gas fee for the transfer.
> - **Transaction hash**: After submitting a transaction, you receive a unique hash (ID) that you can use to track its status on a block explorer.
> - **Token contracts**: The transfer interacts with the USDT smart contract at its specific address, ensuring the correct token is sent.
> - **Paymaster**: If configured, the paymaster can sponsor the gas fees, allowing you to pay transaction costs in USDT instead of the native token (ETH).
> - **Security**: Always double-check the recipient address and the amount before confirming a transfer. Blockchain transactions are irreversible.
