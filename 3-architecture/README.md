# Product Architecture & Core Concepts

### ðŸš§ Work in progress

This section is split into two focus areas:

1. **[Architecture Overview](./architecture-overview.md)** â€“ highâ€‘level system design, data flow and runtime components.
2. **[Core Concepts](./core-concepts.md)** â€“ key objects (WDK, WalletSession, Chain, Signerâ€¦) and privacy fundamentals.

> Start with the overview to understand where each component lives; jump to the concepts page for precise definitions.
