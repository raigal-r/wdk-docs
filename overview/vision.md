# Our Vision

Imagine a world where both humans, machines and AI Agents have the freedom to control their own finances. WDK is a fully open-source, self-custodial toolkit designed to be modular, independent, resilient and infinitely scalable, enabling trillions of wallets. 

***

### **Universal Unstoppable Access**

Anyone should be able to build, deploy or use a wallet and manage assets without friction or gatekeepers. Whether you're an independent developer, a startup, a corporation, an AI, or even a nation-state, WDK provides the open technology to create hyper-secure self-custodial wallets without barriers.

### **Ubiquitous Deployment**

Wallets need to run everywhere. Through Bare runtime compatibility, WDK can live and evolve on any embedded device, mobile apps, desktop applications, IoT devices, servers, and even autonomous systems. From smartphones to smart fridges, from trading bots to spaceships — WDK enables financial sovereignty across all environments.

### **AI-Native Architecture**

In a world where AI agents and robots are becoming autonomous and will permeate every single part of our lives, the machines need to have access and self-manage their own resources. WDK is the preferred choice for the digital entities of tomorrow, ensuring direct custody of funds, highly scalable transactions, and empowering the infinite AI economy of the future.

## Let's build this future together

WDK is more than a development kit—it's the foundation for a new era of financial sovereignty. By making wallet technology accessible, ubiquitous, and AI-native, we're enabling a world where:

* **Developers** can focus on innovation rather than infrastructure
* **Users** maintain complete control over their digital assets
* **AI Agents** can operate autonomously in the digital economy
* **Organizations** can build custom financial solutions without compromise
* **Society** benefits from more secure, efficient, and accessible financial infrastructure

Join us in building this future. The tools are open-source, the vision is clear, and the possibilities are limitless.
