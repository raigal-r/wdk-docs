# Our Vision

Imagine a world where both humans and machines have the freedom to control their own finances. WDK by Tether is a fully open-source, self-custodial toolkit designed to build the most advanced wallet experiences. Modular, independent, and resilient—this is the WDK that puts power back into the hands of developers and their creations.

***

## Three Pillars of Our Vision

### **Universal Access**
Anyone should be able to build a wallet and manage assets without friction. Whether you're an independent developer, a startup, a corporation, or even a nation-state, WDK provides the open technology to create hyper-secure self-custodial wallets without barriers.

### **Ubiquitous Deployment**
Wallets need to run everywhere. Through Bare runtime compatibility, WDK can be embedded in mobile apps, desktop applications, IoT devices, and even autonomous systems. From smartphones to smart fridges, from trading bots to spaceships — WDK enables financial sovereignty across all environments.

### **AI-Native Architecture**
In a world where AI agents and robots are becoming autonomous, they too will need to manage their own resources. WDK is the preferred choice for the digital entities of tomorrow, ensuring they can custody their own funds, make transactions, and operate independently—no human required.

## Core Values

### **Speed**
Go from zero to production wallet in days, not months. Pre-built modules, starters, and UI components accelerate development without compromising quality.

### **Security**
Stateless and non-custodial by design. Keys never leave developer control, ensuring maximum security for both human users and autonomous systems.

### **Modularity**
Pick only what you need. Extensible architecture allows custom modules for new blockchains, protocols, and use cases without vendor lock-in.

### **Ubiquity**
Runs anywhere—Node.js, React Native, Bare runtime, embedded systems. Future-ready for any environment where value exchange is needed.

### **Ecosystem Integration**
Fully open-source with no strings attached. Direct support for Bitcoin, Lightning, USDT, XAUt, and soon USAT, with extensibility to support any token.

## A World of Possibilities

### **Today's Reality**
WDK enables developers to build production-ready wallets for today's users—secure, fast, and reliable applications that put users in control of their digital assets.

### **Tomorrow's Vision**
In an uncertain future or a dystopian present, one thing remains constant: the need for control over one's own assets. WDK offers a fully non-custodial solution that stands resilient, even in the most challenging scenarios.

### **The AI Economy**
A future where humans and machines coexist is not a fantasy—it's our reality. Both will need secure, non-custodial wallets, and WDK by Tether is here to make that possible.

Step into the world of tomorrow with WDK by Tether, developed to provide both humans and robots peace of mind and financial independence.

## Building the Future Together

WDK is more than a development kit—it's the foundation for a new era of financial sovereignty. By making wallet technology accessible, ubiquitous, and AI-native, we're enabling a world where:

- **Developers** can focus on innovation rather than infrastructure
- **Users** maintain complete control over their digital assets
- **AI Agents** can operate autonomously in the digital economy
- **Organizations** can build custom financial solutions without compromise
- **Society** benefits from more secure, efficient, and accessible financial infrastructure

Join us in building this future. The tools are open-source, the vision is clear, and the possibilities are limitless.
